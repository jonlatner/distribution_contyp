\noindent 
There is a perception that temporary employment is rising in Europe, but there is little evidence to support this.  One explanation is that temporary employment is rising, but cross-sectional data underestimate both the size and growth of temporary employment.  Using data on 31 European countries and a sample of prime-age workers, we compare and contrast changes in the temporary employment rate in a single period of time using cross-sectional data from the European Labour Force Survey (LFS), with changes in the risk of experiencing temporary employment in multiple periods of time using longitudinal data from the European Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC).  Our results suggest that the temporary employment rate stagnated over time, but the risk of experiencing it continues to rise.  Cross-sectional data suggests that between 1996 and 2007, the temporary employment rate increased in Europe by 28\%, but between 2007 and 2019, there was little change.  By contrast, panel data suggests that between 2013 and 2019, the risk of experiencing at least one temporary employment contract rose 36\%.  Our contribution provides insight into the nature of employment experiences associated with insecurity.

Country, region specifications are shown in table \ref{table_country_panel_years} in Appendix \ref{appendix_tables}.  Before 2007, levels are rising.  After 2007, levels are constant.  In the Eastern region, Poland stands out, with high and rising levels before 2007, but stagnating levels afterward.  In the Southern region, Spain stands out, with high, but declining levels, especially after 2007.  Italy and the Netherlands are among the few countries with high and rising levels before and after 2007.}

After 2007, the temporary employment rate is constant within almost all demographic groups and regions.  However, there are two exceptions.  In the Southern region, the rate continues to rise in every demographic group, except those with higher levels of education.  Further, among those with lower levels of education, the rate continues to rise in every region, except the Anglophone region.}

Second row plots the probability of experiencing multiple temporary contracts (ref: 1).  Third row plots the probability of experiencing a temporary contract that is multiple years long (ref: 1).  The interpretation is that temporary employment risk is rising, but the relative insecurity of temporary employment may be declining as the risk of receiving a multi-year contract is rising and the risk of receiving multiple contracts is constant or declining.}
