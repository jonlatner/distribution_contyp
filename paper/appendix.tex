\section{Appendix: Sample selection}
\label{appendix_sample}

We apply the following sample selection criteria to the EU-SILC, as shown in table \ref{tables_steps_silc_4}.  There are three main filters.  First, we apply country, panel-level filters.  We restrict all panels to study windows that are four-years long.  While the majority of countries use a four-year long panel, a few use longer study windows.  We exclude country, panel waves with a temporary employment rate of zero or missing.  This affects three countries, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Iceland.\footnote{Denmark in years between 2005 and 2010 (panel waves 2008 to 2013), the United Kingdom in 2008 (panel waves 2008 to 2011), and Iceland in 2009 (2009 panel waves).}  Furthermore, we exclude countries with less than 3 panel waves because 3 periods are necessary to create a trend.  This only affects Germany, which is only present in panel waves 2018 and 2019.

We use 12 panel waves, between 2008 and 2019.  2019 is the most recent year data is available.  Waves prior to the 2007 panel wave only include three years of observational data and the 2007 panel wave only includes 15 countries, compared to 25 or more countries in the other surveys.  Further, after all sample selection criteria are applied, there are only four countries in the 2007 panel wave, compared to 18 in the 2008 panel wave.  The result is 13.502.253 observations in 346 country, panel waves.  

Second, we apply individual-level filters.  The data includes individuals who are prime age (25-54), for the same reasons about the relationship between (in)voluntariness and age with respect to the LFS data, active labor market participants, and have a non zero personal weight.\footnote{There are two exceptions.  In the Netherlands, in panel waves 2016 -- 2019, the personal weight for all observations in the first year of a given panel wave is zero.  Similarly, in Norway, beginning with the 2010 panel waves, only last observation in panel period has personal weight greater than 0.  In these country, panel waves, we recode the personal base weight for these observations in these years as 1 and keep the observations, conditional on meeting all other criteria.}  We exclude individuals who were never employed in a four-year panel wave, otherwise there is no possibility of experiencing temporary employment.  We drop observations with missing values on education, gender, age, and contract type.  The result is 3.675.604 observations in 346 country, panel waves in the sample. 

Third and finally, we apply individual, panel-level filters.  The data only include individuals who are observable in each year of a given four-year panel wave.  Further, we exclude observations with missing or zero longitudinal panel weights, which weights for the inverse probability of being in the sample for the entire panel wave.  This leaves 1.058.840 total observations (264.710 unique observations) in 325 country, panel waves.  This is our `main' dataset.  We note that while not every country is in every panel wave, of the 31 countries in the sample, 23 countries are in at least nine panel waves, as shown in table \ref{table_country_panel_years}.  

To examine our three outcomes of interest, we create three sub datasets from the main dataset.  The first dependent variable is experiencing at least one temporary contract in a given four-year panel wave (i.e. ever).  The reference is an individual who does not experience a temporary contract (i.e. never).  To estimate this outcome, we aggregate the main dataset so each individual is present once in a given country, panel wave.  The result is dataset \emph{A} with 264.710 person, country, panel observations.  

Next, we determine temporary employment `spells' in order to estimate the probability of experiencing temporary employment, by the number and duration of temporary contracts.  We calculate temporary employment spells for each individual in a given country, panel wave using a variable in the dataset that asks, ``Change of job since last year?''  If an individual had a temporary contract in two consecutive time periods, but did not change jobs, then they had one temporary contract for two years.  By contrast, if an individual in two consecutive time periods had a temporary contract, but did change jobs, then they had two temporary contracts, each of which was one year.

The second dependent variable is experiencing two or more, i.e. multiple, temporary contracts in a given panel wave.  The reference is experiencing one, single temporary contract in that same panel wave.  To examine this outcome, we filter from dataset \emph{A} on the condition of ever experiencing temporary employment.  The result is dataset \emph{B} with 48.940 person, country, panel wave observations.  

The third dependent variable is experiencing a temporary contract that is two or more years long, i.e. multiple years.  The reference group is experiencing a temporary contract that is one, single year long.  To examine this outcome, we aggregate the main dataset so each spell of temporary employment is present once in a given country, panel wave, but an individual with multiple spells is present as many times as they have spells in a given country, panel wave.  Further, we filter on the condition of ever experiencing temporary employment.  The result is dataset \emph{C} with 59.582 person-spell, country, panel observations. 

We exclude variables related to income, occupation, and industry.  While including these additional variables into our analysis would improve model fit, it is not clear the degree to which these variables are related to the individual, job, or structural conditions.  For example, in Germany, occupational closure in the form of tasks and credentials are important determinants of temporary employment levels within a given occupation, ranging from 0 to 64 percent \citep{stuth_2017}.  We also do not control for individual self-selection into temporary employment.  Further, instead of relying on a single, unified, multi-level models, we use separate regression models for each panel wave in each country.  In so doing, we ensure that results are a reflection of the data, not model specification.

We use the methods and data describe above to quantify inequalities in temporary employment trends over time as well as between and within countries and demographic groups.  The goal is not to causally isolate an ``effect'' of country and demographic groups on temporary employment risk net of a large number of control variables, nor the consequences of temporary employment, as other research does.  Instead, the primary goal is descriptive.  Results provide a more accurate and representative accounting of levels and trends in temporary employment rate and risk than is otherwise reported, which helps to isolate the source of rising insecurity associated with temporary employment.  Replication files are made available by the authors on GitHub.

\subsection{Sensitivity}

Here, we address several important issues of sensitivity, which we divide into two main parts.  One main part is the sensitivity of the results within a given data set to our particular sample selection criteria.  With respect to the LFS, conditional on being a prime-age worker (25-54) and employed, the other selection criteria reduce the sample by 23.5\% (as shown in table \ref{tables_steps_lfs}).  Of these criteria, the most important one is a contract type, which accounts 17 percentage points.  While contract type is an essential variable required to determine temporary employment rate, results are not sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of the other selection criteria.  

With respect to the SILC, the most important criteria is the requirement that observations be in the sample for all 4 years of a panel period.  This reduces the sample by 71\% (as shown in table \ref{tables_steps_silc_4}).  Alternatively, if we only require an individual to be in the first 2 years of a 4 year panel period, we only lose 37\% of all cases (as shown in table \ref{tables_steps_silc_2}).  While results are qualitatively similar, as shown in figure \ref{graph_eu_silc_compare_2_4_year_panel}, we use a longer time period owing to the application of a life course approach.  Further, results are qualitatively similar using unadjusted, non-parametric data, as shown in figure \ref{graph_eu_silc_compare_2_4_year_panel}.  

The second main part is issue of whether the results are sensitive to the choice of data set used.  Or, put another way, what is the degree to which the samples from the two data sets are comparable?  One way the samples are different is that the LFS sample only include those who are employed, which is how one calculates the temporary employment rate, while the SILC sample include all labour force participants, employed or unemployed.  We compare the temporary employment rate among the employed population to the rate among the employed and unemployed.  Trends are qualitatively similar, as shown in \ref{graph_rate_region_compare_lmp}.  

Another issue of comparison is that it is possible to use the SILC data in a cross-sectional form, as we described above, as well as the 4-year sample we use for our analysis, and the 2-year sample we use for sensitivity.  We compare the annual temporary employment rate between all three versions of SILC sample to LFS sample.  Results are qualitatively similar, as shown in figure \ref{graph_eu_silc_compare_SILC_LFS}.

The two lines are similar, although the rate is always lower using the sample of LMP, as we would expect.  The interpretation is that the temporary employment rate in the LFS is not driven by the sample selection strategy.}
